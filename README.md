Visuo-Tactile Cross Modal prediction

Baseline - Deep Bayes Variational filter

1) Generate dataset - 1000 trajectories for training and 250 trajectories for validation_mod
2) Run train_dbvf.py with correct dataset path
3) Post training check some test examples and analyse

Prior VAE - train_tcvae.py - This is the prior model used within the pcmc model

PCMC - Main latent filter model and training. 

TODO: Cleaning up, commenting and fixing visom visualization
