VT Cross Modal Perception Project

Current Project - Pendulum with varying length, mass and joint friction

1) First step is to train a VAE which should learn to capture the visual cues - position (theta) of the pendulum and the length of the pendulum.

2) Second step is to train a latent filter DBVF to learn the dynamics of the pendulum, while using the learnt static VAE

Before running the scripts, ensure the folder structures are correct - datasets, results, dump
